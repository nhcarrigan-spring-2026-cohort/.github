Hey there! 👋 I'm **Naomi** — a transfem software engineer, community manager, and (failed) VTuber who's passionate about building inclusive tech communities and breaking down barriers in the industry. I am the founder of [NHCarrigan](https://nhcarrigan.com) and the community manager for [freeCodeCamp](https://freecodecamp.org). Bringing these organisations together, I am running a month-long cohort!

## What is the cohort?

This is a month-long event, taking place from February 2, 2026 to March 2, 2026. During this time, participants will be working on teams to develop real-world production-grade products. Participants will gain valuable experience working on a team, and get a sense of what it is like to work in a professional setting.

Most of the collaboration is coordinated through the [freeCodeCamp Discord community](https://discord.gg/KVUmVXA), so participants are expected to join and engage there!

## How do I join?

Right now **APPLICATIONS ARE OPEN!** Please submit our [application form](https://forms.nhcarrigan.com/o/docs/forms/noxhF9r7C66ER2KfVcD2ps/4) - and be sure to join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/KVUmVXA). If you are NOT in the Discord, I will not be able to accept your application!

Applications will be open until **January 22nd**! So if you want to participate, best hurry!

## Do I need to have experience?

Nope! **The primary purpose of this event is to facilitate learning.** We won't deny people for having not learned things! That would defeat the point.

We ask about your experience and knowledge and such because we need to properly balance out the teams. We don't want a team of all new learners, for example, because that would not be a fun time! 

## I have more questions, Naomi!

Awesome! I love answering questions! Join the [freeCodeCamp Discord community](https://discord.gg/KVUmVXA) and ping me! 

## Want to get to know Naomi?

We have our own [Discord community for NHCarrigan](https://chat.nhcarrigan.com), which is the perfect place to connect with us on a more personal level!
